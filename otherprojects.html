							<p> <h3>Abstract</h3>
								The Tucson Arizona Metropolitan area includes 20 different towns and cities within a 1,987 square mile area,
								and nearly 1 million people (USA.com). The population growth between 2002 - 2016 has been around 4% (Census.gov). 
								By using remote sensing we can see the amount of desert landscape that has been developed to accommodate this population growth. 
								By undergoing an unsupervised classification and calculating a change matrix the results are that 14.72% of desert landscape has been 
								developed on. This overdevelopment of desert landscaping has far outpaced population growth.

							<p> <h3>Abstract</h3>
								By looking at the geographic distribution of temperature and dewpoint we can make assumptions about future freeze warnings. We can the then take these analyses to know how to
								 best prepare areas that are under a higher risk for freeze warnings and a higher risk of ice. By looking at a random sample of points and preforming Inverse Distance Weighted 
								 (IDW) interpolation we can get the averages for the entirety of Western Europe.  We see a correlation between the elevation and temperature along with proximity to the coast
								  and dew point. These results will serve as a road sign to where future resources for the winter will need to be placed, and a good starting point for mapping future extreme 
								  winter weather.
