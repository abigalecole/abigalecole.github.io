									<h2>The Basics</h2>
									<p>Examples of maps I have created that embody the fundamentals of cartography<br> The below maps have been created using ArcMap unless otherwise noted</p>

								<h2>Graduated and Proportional Symbol Mapping</h2>
							<img src="images/Lab8-page-001.jpg" width="600" />
							<p> The proportional symbol map is a widely-used form of thematic mapping. In this
							technique, the cartographer selects a symbol and alters its size, the area to be exact, based
							on the data values. There are three methods for setting symbol size: absolute scaling,
							apparent magnitude (perceptual) scaling, and range grading.</p>
							</div>

							<div>
								<h2>Basemaps and Digitizing</h2>
							<img src="images/Cole_Lab3-page-001.jpg" width="600"/>
							<p> GIS map layers come in many forms and are available from a wide range of sources
								including public agencies and private firms. Even though a large amount of spatial data
								currently exists, it is common in mapping for a cartographer to create “from scratch” base
								maps to be used in mapping and GIS analysis. Digitizing data involves tracing over
								pre-existing maps or photographs using a digitizing tablet (for hard-copy maps and
								photos) or onscreen (for digital maps and photos).</p>
							</div>
							<div>
								<h2>Data Entry and Reporting</h2>
							<img src="images/Lab4-page-001.jpg" width="600"/>
							<p> Attribute tables are organized in rows and columns contain all necessary data for
								ArcMap. In ArcMap, the rows are referred to as records while the columns are referred to
								as fields. Records are geographical features. Fields are used to describe a particular
								characteristic of that feature.</p>
							</div>
							<div>
								<h2>Projections and Symbolization</h2>
							<img src="images/Lab5-page-001.jpg" width="600"/>
							<p> There are four families of map projections—azimuthal (planar), cylindrical, conic, and
								mathematical—and there are several individual projections belonging to each
								family.Projection aspect refers to the ―point of view of the projection. A projection’s
								normal aspect is the aspect that produces the simplest geometry for the graticule. For
								example, a graticule made up of straight lines of latitude and longitude intersecting at
								right angles is geometrically simpler than a graticule made up of complex curves. There
								are four aspects a projection may have: Polar, Equatorial, Oblique, and Transverse.</p>
							</div>
							<div>
								<h2>Choropleth Mapping</h2>
							<img src="images/Cole416_Lab6-page-001.jpg" width="600"/>
							<p> One of the most widely used thematic maps is the choropleth map. In this technique,
								symbols represent areas for which data has been collected. Thus, the technique is
								sometimes called enumeration mapping. Typical enumeration areas used for this
								technique include administrative areas such as countries, states, provinces, counties, and
								census tracts.</p>
							</div>
							<div>
								<h2>Dot Density Mapping</h2>
							<img src="images/Lab7-page-001.jpg" width="600"/>
							<p> The dot density map is a very popular form of thematic mapping. The technique is simple
								and straightforward: a dot is used to represent a specific number of items, and the symbol
								is repeated until the total number of items in an area is accounted for. The strength of this
								technique is that it allows the reader to visually infer density without using derived
								tabulated data.</p>
							</div>
							<div>
								<h2>Flow Mapping</h2>
							<img src="images/Cole416_Lab10-page-001.jpg" width="600"/>
							<p> The flow map shows linear movement between places. As such, they are popular maps to
								represent migrations, commodity flows, and traffic patterns. Flow maps may be used to
								show both qualitative data (e.g., connections) or quantitative data (e.g., magnitudes). In
								qualitative flow mapping, the symbols are of uniform width and typically are arrows. In
								quantitative flow mapping, the cartographer selects a line symbol and alters its width
								based on the data values.</p>
